## Get the entire unaltered graph for 2019/2020

## Determine measure that indicates network restoration (Betweeness, Closeness, Clustering, Degree, etc.)

## Determine desired changes to the parameter

## Determine list of edges to be checked (Either top airports or top decrese during the pandemic) (NC2)

## for each edge, make the weight equal to value from 2019
## Calculate difference in parameter for the network and divide by desired change
## Note the effort (Number of flights added) to the edge

## Determine and rank Percentage chage per flight added
